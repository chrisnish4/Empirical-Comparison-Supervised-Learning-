# Supervised-Learning-Final
Reproduced the Caruana et al. experiments comparing and contrasting the efficacy using three different supervised learning algorithms on three different binary classification problems. Utilized accuracy score to account for both type I and type II errors. Performed data engineering capturing three datasets and performing data transforms in order to process any multiclass classification problem to binary and to create 3 germane dimensions: adult array (48,841x14), Covertype array (581,011x54), and Letter recognition array (19,999x16).  Discovered random forest classifier method outperformed both k-nearest neighbor and logistic regression classifier methods on the Adult and Covertype datasets; discovered the K-nearest neighbor method performed the best on Letter recognition dataset
